        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            To descripe oneself is always hard, to one degree there is my technical expertise, on the other there is hobbies, aswell as my beliefs and me as a person. To describe myself as a person I would have ask myself what attributes do I have that make me stand out. I believe compared to most people I'm someone who is willing to openly disagree when an opinon is raised, meaning if you say something I disagree with, you will know. I do believe compared to my fellow pears, I better fits into a polite and respectfull atmosphere. Stuborn against hardships, when I set a goal, it would require alot to change my goal. When hardships comes abound I will stay in the fight, I might change strategy as I learn more about the goal. Also, I'm so far bad at speaking alone to a camera.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
        <p>
            I mostly work in backend, I can work full-stack. Mostly with .NET. I also have a large interest in optimization, I started writing C#, and I learned C++ when optimization is required. I enjoy further decrease computer requirements for running software. One important thing is acthually getting the software out there, therefore I also work with CI/CD, production pipelines, containers (docker) and Kubernetes. These are important factors for getting software out there, therefore I used these technology for most of my projects.
        </p>
